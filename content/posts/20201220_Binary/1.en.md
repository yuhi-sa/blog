# Binary method
To calculate $x=a^k$, it would require $k$ multiplications. However, to efficiently calculate it, we can calculate $a^{2^i}$ sequentially, which reduces the number of calculations to $log(k)$ times. This is called the binary method, which is used in exponentiation calculations such as for RSA decryption.

## Example
To calculate $5^{21}$, it can be expanded as follows:

$5^{21}=5^{2^4}*5^{2^2}*5^{2^0}$ 

By expanding it into binary and calculating from left to right, the calculation can be executed using the binary representation of $21$, which is $10101$ in binary.

$5^{21} = 5^{(10101)_2} = 5^{(12^4 + 02^3 + 12^2 + 02^1 + 1*2^0)_2} = 5^{16} * 5^{4} * 5^{1}$

This significantly reduces the number of calculations required.

# Program
The following is a Python program that performs exponentiation calculation using the binary method.
```binary.py
def binary_exponentiation(k: int, g: int, p: int) -> int:
    # Convert to binary representation
    k_binary = []
    while k != 0:
        k_binary.append(k % 2)
        k = k // 2
        if k == 1:
            k_binary.append(k)
            k = 0
    
    # Exponentiation calculation using binary method
    y = 1
    for i in reversed(range(len(k_binary))):
        if k_binary[i] == 1:
            y = (y * y % p) * g % p
        else:
            y = (y * y % p)
    
    return y
```
This program takes as input the exponent $k$, base $g$, and modulus $p$ of the exponentiation, performs exponentiation calculation using the binary method, and returns the calculated result.
